    "filled_paragraph": "The systematic search strategy across 10 target drugs yielded a substantial corpus of biomedical literature for analysis. PubMed queries based on drug name and MeSH term co-occurrence identified a total of 97,963 publications. After applying filtering criteria requiring disease/condition MeSH descriptors with therapeutic use qualifiers, 73,736 publications were retained for processing, representing 75.3% of the initial retrieval set. The filtered corpus provided comprehensive coverage across diverse therapeutic areas, with individual drug datasets ranging from 2,873 to 9,990 publications per drug (mean: 7374.0 Â± 2759.0). Publications were distributed across 9,712 distinct disease/condition MeSH descriptor categories, enabling systematic evaluation of therapeutic relationships across multiple medical specialties. The temporal distribution of retrieved articles showed 39.7% published within the last 10 years, ensuring contemporary clinical relevance while maintaining historical therapeutic knowledge coverage. This literature corpus served as the foundation for both the traditional MeSH-based analysis and the novel LLM-based indication extraction approaches, providing a robust dataset for comparative evaluation of therapeutic knowledge discovery methodologies.\n",
