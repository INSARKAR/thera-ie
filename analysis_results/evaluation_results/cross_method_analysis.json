The average confidence scores for extracted indications were 0.79 ± 0.1 for the Naïve method and 0.73 ± 0.15 for the PubMed method. Notable discoveries included Hypertension for Amlodipine (confidence: 0.9, supported by 3 publications), demonstrating the system's ability to identify clinically plausible therapeutic applications supported by literature evidence. Processing efficiency averaged 2.9 ± 0.2 minutes per drug for the Naïve approach and 7.9 ± 0.7 minutes for the PubMed approach, indicating practical scalability for larger pharmaceutical datasets.\n",
