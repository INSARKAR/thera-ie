### `mesh_snomed_mapping_report.txt`
- **Purpose**: Analysis of MeSH to SNOMED CT terminology mapping
- **Generated**: July 29, 2025
- **Content**:
  - Mapping statistics (87.69% overall mapping rate)
  - 5,628 total MeSH descriptors analyzed
  - 4,042 direct mappings found
  - 893 hierarchical mappings found
  - 693 unmapped descriptors listed
  - Detailed mapping examples

### Usage
This report was generated during the development of THERA-IE to understand the coverage and quality of terminology mapping between MeSH (used in PubMed literature) and SNOMED CT (used for standardized medical coding).

### Future Extensions
This directory can contain additional mapping reports for:
- ICD-10 to SNOMED CT mappings
- Drug name to RxNorm mappings
- Other medical terminology crosswalks
